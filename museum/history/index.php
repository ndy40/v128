            <h2>A Brief History of Sierra Leone National Museum</h2>
            
            <div>
                <p>
                    The origins  of the Sierra Leone National Museum can be traced to the passing of a 1946 
                    ordinance 'to provide for the preservation of Ancient, Historical, and Natural  Monuments, 
                    Relics, and other objects of Archaeological, Ethnographical,  Historical or other Scientific 
                    Interest'. Although the Monuments and Relics  Commission, which was set up under this ordinance, 
                    was not explicitly charged  with establishing a museum, this was identified as one of the priorities 
                    of the  organisation in its first annual report. Under the chairmanship of Dr M. C. F.  Easmon, a 
                    retired Krio physician and amateur historian, a collection of  artefacts was gradually assembled and 
                    a temporary display set up in the library  of the British Council. This collection was envisaged as 
                    the nucleus of a  future museum.

                    Despite the  hard work of Easmon and other members of the Monuments and Relics Commission, it was the 
                    personal enthusiasm of Sir Robert Hall, Governor of Sierra Leone between 1952 and 1956, that these 
                    plans for a museum began to materialise. In 1953, Hall promoted the establishment of the Sierra Leone 
                    Society, the stated aim of which was to encourage the advancement of knowledge about what was then the 
                    Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone. In his address to the inaugural meeting of the Society in 1954, 
                    Hall lamented the decline in Sierra Leone’s traditional arts and crafts, and challenged the membership 
                    to establish a museum, which he argued could ‘contribute towards the growth of national pride in what 
                    is past and what is traditional, by collecting and preserving objects and making them available for 
                    contemplation and study’. A Museum Committee was  duly set up within the Sierra Leone Society to take the 
                    agenda forward. As well as Easmon, a number of other prominent Sierra Leoneans were actively involved, 
                    including Ernest Jenner Wright (a distinguished medical doctor), Christopher  Okoro Cole (a senior lawyer 
                    who became Chief Justice and later Acting Governor-General of Sierra Leone), Arthur Porter (a historian 
                    who later became Vice Chancellor of the University of Sierra Leone), and Wilmot Dillsworth (a town clerk 
                    on Freetown City Council who succeeded Easmon as chair of the Monuments and Relics  Commission).

                    In 1955 Hall  offered to lease the old Cotton Tree Telephone Exchange (previously Cotton Tree Railway 
                    Station) to the Society for a nominal annual sum as temporary accommodation for the museum. The Society 
                    accepted the Governor’s offer and the minutes of its meetings record that the museum was to be named ‘THE 
                    SIERRA LEONE MUSEUM’, with the hope expressed ‘that this will in due course develop into a true National 
                    Museum of Sierra Leone’. Through 1956 and 1957 the disused telephone exchange was gradually refurbished, 
                    the collections assembled by the Monuments and Relics Commission were donated, and the new museum’s 
                    displays were organised. Easmon’s adept facilitation at this time was crucial and his ability to 
                    co-ordinate input across the Monuments and Relics Commission, the Sierra Leone Society, and the Sierra 
                    Leone Society’s Museum Committee was aided  by the fact that he was then serving as chairman to all three 
                    entities  simultaneously. Indeed, to these roles he would also add that of Curator, since the Museum 
                    Committee’s attempts to raise sponsorship funds to employ a trained curator for the museum were not 
                    successful and the task inevitably fell on his  shoulders.

                    The Sierra  Leone Museum was officially opened on 10th December 1957 by Sierra Leone’s Chief Minister 
                    (soon to become Prime Minister), Sir Milton Margai. This was the  same year that national museums were 
                    opened in Ghana and Nigeria. According to the Monuments and Relics Commission report for 1957, a staggering 
                    10,000 people visited the museum in its first week of opening, and subsequent museum reports show that 
                    annual attendance figures in excess of 250,000 were sustained into the mid-1970s.

                    In 1967, the Sierra Leone Society’s ambitions for the museum came to fruition and the Sierra Leone Museum 
                    finally became Sierra Leone’s <em>national</em> museum. The Sierra Leone Society had gone into decline after 
                    independence and had become defunct by 1964, its academic activities being superseded the same year by the 
                    establishment of a new Institute of Africa Studies at Fourah Bay College. Through an amendment of the 
                    Monuments and Relics Act in 1967, Sierra Leone’s Monuments and Relics Commission was given authority to 
                    ‘acquire, maintain and administer the Sierra Leone Museum founded by the Sierra Leone Society’. At that time, 
                    the Commission itself fell under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education, but was transferred, in 1973, 
                    to the Ministry of Tourism and Cultural Affairs following a reorganisation of government departments.
