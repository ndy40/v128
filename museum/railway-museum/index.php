                        The Sierra Leone National Railway Museum was opened in 2005 in the old railway workshops 
                        in the Cline Town area of Freetown. The museum has a fine collection of historical 2’6” 
                        gauge railway locomotives, coaches, wagons and related equipment from the former Sierra 
                        Leone Railway that once connected Freetown to Pendembu via the second principal city of Bo, 
                        and to the major town of Makeni.

                        Established in 1895, the Sierra Leone Railway started its first passenger train service to 
                        the provinces in 1898. The Railway was closed in 1975 and the locomotives and carriages that 
                        now form the major part of the museum’s collection languished in the Cline Town workshops for 
                        30 years, suffering from numerous acts of vandalism during the civil war.

                    <p>
                        The collection is now under restoration by local skilled employees, with guidance and support 
                        by the UK National Railway Museum. Exhibits include:
